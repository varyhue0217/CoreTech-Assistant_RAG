# Multilingual Biodiversity Data Chatbot

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing global access to biodiversity data by creating a multilingual chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. The chatbot is designed to bridge language gaps and simplify the complex Darwin Core (DWC) standard, making it easier for users to access, understand, and contribute to biodiversity data.

## Features

- **Multilingual Support:** The chatbot can detect and respond in multiple languages, making biodiversity data accessible to non-English-speaking communities.
- **RAG-Enhanced Knowledge:** The chatbot uses RAG technology to retrieve expert-level information from various biodiversity data standards, including Darwin Core.
- **Simplified Data Access:** By converting DWC documents from XML to CSV, the chatbot can better interpret and provide meaningful insights from the data.

## RAG Data Files

The RAG data files used by the chatbot have been preprocessed and are available in the following directory:
